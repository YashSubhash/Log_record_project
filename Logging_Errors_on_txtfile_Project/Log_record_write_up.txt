1.As per the requirement I have created the log record project,
	I have done a simple calculator which includes addition,subtraction,multiplication,division.
	In division,when the denominator is 0,
	the error message is given in the try block and the catch block catches the message and
         displays it in the error.txt file

while enter the wrong input

3.My javascript code create text file called Errors.txt 
and write tha all errors in that file
